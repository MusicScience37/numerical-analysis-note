  abstract = {The package REGULARIZATION TOOLS consists of 54 Matlab routines for analysis and solution of discrete ill-posed problems, i.e., systems of linear equations whose coefficient matrix has the properties that its condition number is very large, and its singular values decay gradually to zero. Such problems typically arise in connection with discretization of Fredholm integral equations of the first kind, and similar ill-posed problems. Some form of regularization is always required in order to compute a stabilized solution to discrete ill-posed problems. The purpose of REGULARIZATION TOOLS is to provide the user with easy-to-use rou-tines, based on numerical robust and efficient algorithms, for doing experiments with regularization of discrete ill-posed problems. By means of this package, the user can experiment with different regularization strategies, compare them, and draw conclusions from these experiments that would otherwise require a major programming effort. For discrete ill-posed problems, which are indeed difficult to treat numerically, such an approach is certainly superior to a single black-box routine. This paper describes the underlying theory and gives an overview of the package; a complete manual is also available I},

  abstract      = {When discrete ill-posed problems are analyzed and solved by various numerical regularization techniques, a very convenient way to display information about the regularized solution is to plot the norm or seminorm of the solution versus the norm of the residual vector. In particular, the graph associated with Tikhonov regularization plays a central role. The main purpose of this paper is to advocate the use of this graph in the numerical treatment of discrete ill-posed problems. The graph is characterized quantitatively, and several important relations between regularized solutions and the graph are derived. It is also demonstrated that several methods choosing for the regularization parameter are related to locating a characteristic L-shaped "corner" of the graph},

  abstract = {Regularization algorithms are often used to produce reasonable solutions to ill-posed problems. The L-curve is a plot—for all valid regularization parameters—of the size of the regularized solution versus the size of the corresponding residual. Two main results are established. First a unifying characterization of various regularization methods is given and it is shown that the measurement of “size” is dependent on the particular regularization method chosen. For example, the 2-norm is appropriate for Tikhonov regularization, but a 1-norm in the coordinate system of the singular value decomposition (SVD) is relevant to truncated SVD regularization. Second, a new method is proposed for choosing the regularization parameter based on the L-curve, and it is shown how this method can be implemented efficiently. The method is compared to generalized cross validation and this new method is shown to be more robust in the presence of correlated errors.},
